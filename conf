# czram configuration file

# Size of the zram device. Supports absolute sizes (e.g., 2G, 512M)
# or a percentage of total RAM (e.g., 25%RAM).
SIZE=25%RAM

# Compression algorithm to use.
# Recommended: zstd (fast and efficient)
ALGO=zstd

# Swap priority for zram (0â€“32767).
# Higher means more preferred for swapping.
# 32767 is ideal for compressed RAM-based swap.
PRIO=32767
